# üêÑCowsay What?

My own implementation of Cowsay but in Go. This is not a CLI tool. When ran, it generates random pre-defined animals and [fortunes](http://fortunes.pbworks.com/w/browse/#view=ViewUnfiled)

## Usage

It is very simple to run. Make sure you have Go installed on you system.

Thereafter go to the directory of the project and simple run the command below

```Go
go run .
```
